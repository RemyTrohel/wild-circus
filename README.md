# Wild Circus V2

This prototype was created in the span of 2 days, during the Checkpoint 4.  
It concludes the 5 months formation of Java web developper.  

The purpose of this exercise was to assess our progression by comparing the result with the [first Wild circus](https://github.com/RemyTrohel/wild-circus-v1) created before the formation (static website)

# Checkpoint 4

## Objectives

* validate your ability to create a web application
* validate your developer's skills
* give your best
* make the wildest circus ever
* impress yourself by your progress in 5 months.

## Steps

### Wild Circus

Long time ago, in order to become a web developer, you managed to realise a simple static web page, *the Wild Circus*.

Since, you learned to develop great websites with a lot of dynamic features.

To evaluate this progress, let's build a new Wild Circus experience with all these new skills.

You are free to design this experience as you wish, here some ideas to inspire you (*these are examples, not required features*):
* an administration panel to add/edit circus acts
* a gallery of your fellows wilders portrayed as circus artists
* a selling ticket system
* *a wild circus shows around you* geolocation system
* *awesome stuff from your imagination*, your are your own product owner !

Requirements:
* The site must be responsive
* Data are stored in a MySQL database
* Good practices are respected  (tests are a big plus)
* The project will be available on **your personal Github**

### Wait, don't code right now!!!

As in any project, a good start is crucial to succeed.

You learned to code but you also learned to prepare. So, think before acting !

On the first morning of this checkpoint, we ask you to:
* write user stories (about 3 or 5)
* draw a wireframe (not too many pages)
* realise the conceptual data model ([fr]MCD)

All these items should be found in the *resources* folder in your repository 
(take pictures of your drawings).

For wireframes and data model, except if you are an expert with tools, you should do it on paper! Don’t waste time with an app you don’t know how it works! Use this good old pen and a sheet of paper.

Before coding, validate it with your trainer. 
If your trainer takes too much time to validate your primary work, because your colleagues took him in hostage, you can start coding, but, keep in mind your application could hanged after your trainer’s review.

### Code, code and then code

Code the features, use the git branches, test your code. You know the drill.

If you get stuck, *once you have tried everything*, call your trainer to the rescue through slack.

## Challenge

### The first morning.

Works on the preparation part of your project.
* Draw the wireframe
* Make the CMD(MCD)
* Write user stories

You must validate this work with your trainer during this morning. Then you can start to code.

### Make it available on GitHub

At the end of the second day you can send to your trainer a link to your repository.
In the Readme.md file, you must expose how to install and run your application.
Your repository must have a resources folder with a picture of the wireframe, the CMD ([fr] MCD) and the product backlog.

Do your best to give a wild experience to users!
